            The client company aims to create an investment educational analytic tool that gives users a sense of
            holistic endowment in investing as it mines, compiles, and normalizes countless hours of financial research
            into a decision-ready display, accompanied by educational elements. This product will be a web-based
            software platform or app. At the core of the product is a bundle of benefits, which are confidence in
            investing and the convenience of gathering data at oneâ€™s fingertips. For now, none of the competitors has
            both educational components and the data analytics tool to compare company financial health side-by-side.
            Given such an opportunity, we are looking to develop a minimal viable product by building prototypes and
            testing with potential clients and stakeholders.</p>
