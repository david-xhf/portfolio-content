            The client company aims to create an investment educational analytic tool that gives users a sense of
            holistic endowment in investing as it mines, compiles, and normalizes countless hours of financial research
            into a decision-ready display, accompanied by educational elements. This product will be a web-based
            software platform or app. At the core of the product is a bundle of benefits, which are confidence in
            investing and the convenience of gathering data at one's fingertips. For now, none of the competitors has
            both educational components and the data analytics tool to compare company financial health side-by-side.
            Given such an opportunity, we are looking to develop a minimal viable product by building prototypes and
            testing with potential clients and stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Stage 1 Understand
            In this part, We conducted multifaceted researches to better understand our problem space.
            First, we shared our prior knowledge about the context, the problem and listed a few existing apps and
            services. Next, we reflected on our own identities and how they can influence what we observe, interpret,
            and elicit from people and situations. We then created a list of our assumptions and biases on the context
            and refined our topic. Finally, we held five semi-structured interviews with participants recognized as the
            users or bystanders.

            Stage 2 Synthesize
            In this part, we first debriefed the notes from the interview, namely breaking them down into simply key
            data and putting them on sticky notes. As you can see from the board below, some participants are frequent
            bus users, some are active walkers and some others own a car bus still use buses. We intentionally recruited
            them to create a diverse sample so that we could understand the needs of different groups of users.

            Debrief

            Using sticky notes from the above debriefing board, we then organized them to find patterns.
            We found that users often switch between a few apps in order to get to their destination. For example, they
            used Google Maps to plan their trip and another real-time bus information app to track the bus. Another
            thing that drew our attention was those safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students often need
            to show bus drivers their Building Access Status through another app. Moreover, first-year students often
            had difficulty getting to their classroom within the building and hoped some app could lead them to it.
            Seasonal factors also influenced users' experience. For example, snowy days made it hard to walk outside
            since it was slippery and cold. However, buses were more likely to delay and made users stressed, especially
            when they head to a meeting or class.

            Organize

            Using patterns found from the Organize board, we developed four insights...
            Insight 1
            Insight 1
            Insight 2
            Insight 2
            Insight 3
            Insight 3
            Insight 4
            Insight 4
            ... and framed nine How Might We questions.

            How Might We's

            Our users followed similar sets of behaviors when they took the bus from one place to another. We created a
            journey map to better interpret them.

            Stage 3 Ideate
            Based on our insights, we further defined the design goal, brainstormed, and voted for design alternatives.
            We generated a bunch of ideas for the nine HMW's we framed before.

            Generate Ideas

            We then organized and voted for our favorite idea and prepare for prototyping.

            Our favorite functionality

            Stage 4 Prototype
            We planed a three-step prototype process: elemental, aspectual, and integrative.
            In the elemental prototype, we drew storyboards and interpreted them for our users. We asked where and why
            they feel confused.
            Siqi was especially curious about the privacy issue incurred by the rider interface since it would be
            actively tracking users during the whole trip.
            Xiao, as a Computer Science student, was wondering how we could integrate bus data with Google Maps API.
            ......
            After hearing about their concerns and iterating on our prototypes, we created our first version
            high-fidelity prototype.​​​​​​​


            Storyboards (finished as a team)

            Final Design

            We are currently working on our high-fidelity prototype and expect it to be done by January 2022. Stay
            tuned! </p>
