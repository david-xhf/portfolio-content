            The client company aims to create an investment educational analytic tool that gives users a sense of
            holistic endowment in investing as it mines, compiles, and normalizes countless hours of financial research
            into a decision-ready display, accompanied by educational elements. This product will be a web-based
            software platform or app. At the core of the product is a bundle of benefits, which are confidence in
            investing and the convenience of gathering data at one’s fingertips. For now, none of the competitors has
            both educational components and the data analytics tool to compare company financial health side-by-side.
            Given such an opportunity, we are looking to develop a minimal viable product by building prototypes and
            testing with potential clients and stakeholders.</p>
